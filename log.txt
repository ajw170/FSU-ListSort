Phase 1: Sepember 22 5PM - 12AM

The first phase of the project was getting oriented with everything.  I first wanted to establish my general
strategy for sorting the list.  Assuming I have an original list that looks like this:

Head - Link 1 - Link 2 - Link 3 - Link 4 - Tail

I determined that using the bottom-up merge sort method would require me to sort every group of 2^n links.
So, on the first iteration, Link 1 and Link 2 would wind up in the correct order, and Link 3 and Link 4 would
wind up in the correct order.  Then, the Link1-Link2 sublist would be merged with the Link3-Link4 sublist, and
so on, until the entire list is sorted.

Care will need to be taken to ensure edge cases are taken care of, for example, empty sublists, or sizes less
than the sublink size at the end for example.

I will be using a modified version of lsort.cpp during development to do quick tests.


Phase 2: Setember 26, 6PM-12AM

This is where the meat of the project comes in.
